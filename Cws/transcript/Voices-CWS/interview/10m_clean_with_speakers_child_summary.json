  "summary": "I have been learning different ways to get over my fear of stuttering. I think this place is safe because I used to have a fear of speaking and I still do. I've had a stutter since I was five and I'm ten now. I had to do a presentation in third grade and it was hard at first but got easier. I think one-on-one is better than a big group, but I'm okay with big groups too.",
  "quotes": [
    "it's okay if you stutter &-um since it's a good thing kind of if you stutter since if you &-um like camp and you stutter",
    "you should let them take their time and it's one if they need to say like one sentence"
