  "summary": "I've been coming to Friends for two years, and it's a really different experience from when I was in the Tween section. I made friends here that I still talk to every day, and we Facetime a lot. My speech started when I was in third grade, and I've always had problems with my R's and L's. I go to speech therapy on the K State campus, and I've learned a lot about stuttering, including how it happens and about famous people who stutter. I'd like speech therapists to make people not care about their stutter, but not let it impact their daily life.",
