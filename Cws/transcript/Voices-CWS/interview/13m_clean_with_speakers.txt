INV: alrighty so tell me about some of the things you've been doing at Friends so far
CHI: so I think that I have been reading some books
CHI: also I do not exactly like all of the speeches speeches they do in the main room because I don't know but I feel like those speeches kind of basically took I think forever to just +...
CHI: so also just I do not know but it felt like that stuff just took took actually like forever to complete and it was oh boy and I was not the biggest fan of it
CHI: so &-uh yeah so I have been so I think that I have been reading some books and other than that nothing because other than those books I brought I have brought nothing nothing else so I was basically bored for the rest of the time that I was not reading my books
CHI: because just hey well just yeah just oh boy I do not know why but hey just so I did not think that everybody can explain the other reasons &-you_know so yeah yeah
INV: alright thank you for sharing my next question is do you know why your family decided to come to the Friends conference this year
CHI: &-um so I think that it was because like so I think that I have been so I think that I have been going to speech therapy for a couple of years
CHI: and then so I think that one year I think that my mom started talking with with I with I think my with with I with I think my speech therapist
CHI: and then basically one day so then after that there I was at the winter conference and then I basically started from there so yeah so
CHI: so yeah so it all started with my mom actually talking to my speech therapist about some speech therapist about some stuff that I did not exactly hear because I was too distracted
CHI: because I was actually too distracted playing on my mom's phone and stuff so yeah yeah
INV: oh wow thank you for sharing
INV: so my next question is have you met any kids here and what have you guys done
CHI: so I think that I &-um so I remember that in the &+th so I remember that during the time in the so I think that during the time that we were in in the other room with all of the younger kids so I remember that I did meet name and I remember that the just so I remember that the other one's first name started with an a@l
CHI: but I don't remember what it was so I'm probably going to hafta ask my mom about that
CHI: so yeah so I remember Name but then I don't remember the second one so yeah
INV: okay thank you for sharing
INV: &-um so can you tell me a little bit about the way you talk
CHI: so I think that sometimes it is like a little bit of so I think that sometimes it is a tad bit of a REPETION repeating thing and then after that sometimes it is the occasional repeat
CHI: and &-um so I don't remember any of the other ones that I used to do when I stutter but I do remember that I so I remember that I did use a bounce a couple of times and also a stretch so yeah those ones have been very helpful so yeah
INV: thank you for sharing
INV: &-um so what have you learned about stuttering so far in your life
CHI: so I remember that a_lot_of famous people stuttered including of course our brand new president Joe_Biden
CHI: so also so so also also going to say so also I am going to also say I was not your biggest fan Mr_Trump boot
CHI: and then like off he goes just boot and then like off off you go to somewhere where I am not planning to investigate any time soon but yeah
CHI: because I think that not everybody exactly liked liked Trump because he was basically a hypocrite but not Joe_Biden no sirree he was basically the exact opposite of him &-um
CHI: so also I have learned I think though that even though if I think you stutter and also have a little bit of autism kind of like I do you can still make some friends
CHI: so also now I remember what my second friend's name was so I think that her name was Name so yeah so
CHI: so so &-uh yeah so I have learned that a_lot_of famous people stutter and also I have learned that this is probably my new motto so it is that so so it is that even though you stutter and also have a little bit of autism like I do you can still make friends tadah and yeah
INV: exactly and my last question for you is what do you want speech therapists to know
CHI: so I think that I want them to know that &-hm so I think that I want them to know that I am quite the comedian
CHI: so also I also want them to know that I am not like a Jerry_Seinfeld clone like I think my parents are sometimes
CHI: so &-uh yeah so I want all my speech therapists to know that I am quite quite the comedian
CHI: but also not like a Jerry_Seinfeld clone like I think my parents are sometimes so yeah
INV: thank you for sharing that concludes our interview
CHI: okay
