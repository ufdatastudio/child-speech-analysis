  "summary": "I feel like stuttering was frustrating when I was younger because people made fun of me. I've learned to accept my stuttering and it's okay. I don't need to be completely fluent, it's just about getting what I want to say out. Successful communication isn't about being completely clean, it's about getting what you want to say. I think therapists should focus on giving clients tools to deal with stuttering and not push anything they're not comfortable with.",
