INV: okay my first one is can you tell me about some of the things you've been doing at the Friends meeting so far
INV: and what else you want to do while you're still at the meeting
PAR: um well this is my second year coming here
PAR: so um so so I was able to um like so I was able to do like a lot of like because when I came here first time
PAR: that was two years ago and I was eleven so I did the Tween and like and now I'm doing the teen and like
PAR: like main stuff so it's a really different experience because I cause I remember the Tween in the Tween section um we did like games and we didn't really talk about stuttering well we did but like it wasn't very in depth like big conversations of it
PAR: but in the teen in the High Schooler section like classes or whatever like meetings I don't know what they're called um they like they like talk more in depth about like what it is like to stutter
PAR: and I thought that was really cool
PAR: and I've also got to see friends that I haven't seen in two years when I met the first year I came here
PAR: um and I really liked it
INV: that's great
INV: glad you can keep those connections alive
INV: it's nice to have a place to gather
INV: alright
INV: so our next question is do you know why your family decided to come back to Friends
PAR: um well the first year they came because my speech therapist um was like oh was like just basically the idea that we could go to Friends and then we got more involved in it
PAR: and I couldn't come two like last year because I was on vacation cause we planned vacation even before we came to the Friends the year before
PAR: so we planned it like two years two or three years ahead and we couldn't really cancel it for like a cruise you know it's expensive
PAR: so um so I think the main reason we came to Friends is because like I made like best friends here
PAR: that like I talk to still like everyday we facetime a lot and stuff like that
PAR: um and we're like so far away and we never get to see each other and um and also because I think my mom doesn't really talk about it I think she really likes the community here thought
PAR: and I think it's mostly because of me though
INV: that's really nice to here
INV: okay so my next question is have you met any other teens and kids your age what have you done or talked about
PAR: um so I got close so as I said already knew my like good friends and I also made some new friends they weren't like I don't know them as well as my friends I have right now
PAR: but it was really nice to like have people who like stutter with us
PAR: and we talked about like everything we just talk normally
PAR: about like teen stuff I don't know
PAR: we just talk about random stuff um and we just like and we sometimes talk about like stuttering when we're in like um like the meeting class thingies
PAR: um but that's like basically all
INV: good
INV: alright
INV: my next question is can you tell me about your speech
PAR: um my speech started when I was in when it started mainly when I was in third grade but people started noticing it like in the beginning of fourth grade
PAR: um and I've always had problems with my r's and with my L's when I was in preschool
PAR: and like to second grade
PAR: and then in third grade I had problems with my r's so I had to and I'm still working on my r's right now they're getting mostly good
PAR: um and so I'm pretty sure that's why that's one of the reasons I developed like my stutter
PAR: and um and so we've got them like almost past r's
PAR: but they're just still a little bit um and I go to and we live on like a college campus we live at K State like
PAR: on like the K State campus in Kansas um so we so I go to speech therapy there
PAR: and then in sixth grade and like last year and like ever since then I've went to um school I went to school therapy to school um get therapy to for like almost every year I've been there
PAR: and they just like pulled me out of class for like thirty minutes but then in middle school I said like I think like I think me being at K State is good enough I don't need to like be at two places
PAR: and I also don't really like getting pulled out of class
PAR: um but and I feel like and sometimes there's like bad days sometimes there's like good days
PAR: and sometimes and like the bad days are like it's kind of like random
PAR: um and they usually like um and they and like sometimes I get into like bigger blocks
PAR: um and it's usually what I've noticed is that it's usually at the beginning of a sentence beginning of a phrase whatever um and it's like um yeah
INV: thank you for sharing all that okay
INV: we have three more questions
INV: so can you tell me about the times when it's easier and harder to speak
PAR: um it's easier usually when the room is quiet
PAR: because my stutter is more like big when I talk fast and when it's louder
PAR: um and talking fast I've always talked fast
PAR: so that can't really change but when it's quiet my stutter like calms down a little bit and then when it's loud I usually get like a lot of the blocks
PAR: and stuff so like if there's like the lunch with my friends I'll get a lot of blocks there because it's so loud
PAR: um uh um and when it's easier to stutter or when it's easier to like with fluency um it I do theater to like I have to like practice my lines a lot to like make sure I don't I still stutter sometimes on lines but sometimes but I practice them in like small phrases like mostly in small phrases and then for each like sentence
PAR: and then l turn it into like a big sentence and I memorize it
PAR: and I make sure like sometimes I remember in a play I had to interrupt someone and that was really hard for me because
PAR: because she like kept going and I had to like stop her and that's really and that line was really hard for me
PAR: I did it really fast
PAR: and so people we're gonna understand me
PAR: so yeah
INV: okay my next question is what have you learned about stuttering
PAR: um when I started going to my college uh campus like therapy um I like it was like a big change because I learned a lot about stuttering I learned like how it happens
PAR: and I know like the first year we like read a lot of I can't say it
PAR: um about stuttering um and so uh yeah
PAR: so I know a lot about stuttering I know and one of the main focuses we did was famous people who stutter because like I'm an actor like I like theater and like I know famous people who stutter
PAR: and so like theater or just like famous people who stutter and like still accomplish stuff
PAR: so
INV: that's cool
INV: alright here's my last question
INV: is there anything you'd like to say to people wanting to become speech therapists
INV: and what could they do that would help you most
PAR: um what I'd say is like try to like make like your person like not care about their stutter or like make them care but like not like impact their daily life
PAR: make them like not scared to speak make them like not be scared like to speak in front of a class
PAR: or like just speak presentations or something
PAR: and like it's still okay if they're like scared or like
PAR: but like make sure like they I think everyone should be like they should have a positive outcome about stuttering
INV: that's great this are all the questions I have for you
