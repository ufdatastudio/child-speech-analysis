  "summary": "I've met other kids my age who stutter and we've been to workshops and outings together. I want to make connections with people my own age who stutter because I don't have that at home. I've learned that people stutter differently and cope with it in different ways by talking to others who stutter. I've been to a speech therapist before, but it was more about acceptance and embracing my stutter, not just trying to change it. I'm comfortable with my stutter now and I think speech therapy should focus on acceptance and self-advocacy.",
  "quotes": [
    "it's alright to leave that unspoken cause we all know that we understand it",
    "if the kid doesn't really care what their fluency rate is then there's no point in putting them through the stress and the self loathing that sometimes fluency goal based speech therapy can impose"
