  "summary": "I've been hanging out with friends and attending sessions and panels at the convention. It's been an impactful experience and a great community for me. I've met lots of people here, including other teens and kids my age, and we talk about shared experiences and school and stuttering. I have a mild to intermediate stutter, and it gets worse when I'm excited or nervous. I've learned that stuttering is a neurological disorder, and it's interesting to understand what's happening in the brain.",
