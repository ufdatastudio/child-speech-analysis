INV: &-uh tell me about some of the things you've been doing at the friends meeting so far
CHI: so &-um I've been &-um talking to &-um speech therapists who &-um want like to what they should do with their colleagues
CHI: and I've been going in some groups to talk about past experiences and &-um how's life going and stuff
INV: cool
INV: I'm gonna come back the last question is gonna be about what you wanna tell the speech therapists
CHI: alright
INV: so we're gonna come back to that idea
CHI: alright
INV: &-uh what else do you wanna do while you're here
CHI: &-um I would like to &-um sorry &-um I would like to learn more about stuttering itself because &-um no one exactly knows what it is but I would like to have a basic thing of what it is explanation
INV: &-um one of the questions I was gonna ask you
INV: oh okay &-um do you know why your family decided to come here
CHI: yeah so &-um the first year we came here &-um I was told about it by &-um chalk and they &-um just did this away camp &-um for friends
CHI: so at first we just came to &-um see what it's like about and stuff
CHI: but then we found out it's like a great experience with changing
CHI: It's boosted my confidence
CHI: so then we kept coming back and yeah
INV: cool
CHI: now I am here
INV: &-um have you met any kids here
CHI: yeah so &-um a_lot_of my &-um friends who I keep in touch with for like a long time are from here
CHI: &-um so that's great because a_lot_of them also suffer from stuttering
CHI: so we can always talk about that so that's great
CHI: &-um yeah
INV: cool
INV: &-um what have you done with the kids or talked about with the other kids
CHI: so me and my friends here always talk about like our voice and stuff
CHI: &-um we talk about past experiences &-um what like if we're being bullied
CHI: or &-like how's school
CHI: how are the kids back at home
INV: mhm alright
INV: can you tell me about times that it's easier to talk
INV: oh no first can you tell me about your talking
CHI: so &-um my stutter is I have repetition and blocks
CHI: &-um it's not as clear and as fluency as how other people speak &-um but that's okay
INV: &-um can you tell me about times that it's easier to talk
CHI: &-um so when I'm not like in a tough situation or if I don't have like a surge of emotions
CHI: either if it's like &-um sad nervous or excited that's when I stutter with a lot more tension and stuff
CHI: &-um and then it's a lot easier to talk more fluency when I'm with people who like I know and can trust
INV: so you kinda talked about this
CHI: yeah
INV: is there anything else you wanna say about times when it's harder to talk
CHI: &-um I don't know what else to sorry
INV: you kinda covered it
INV: &-um what have you learned about stuttering
CHI: so over the years I've learned that stuttering is just like a part of me that makes me special
CHI: &-um I've learned that it's when someone doesn't speak as fluently
CHI: there's blocks repetition there's like I don't know what else sorry I'm not prepared but &-um there's wait what was the question
INV: what have you learned about stuttering
CHI: alright so I've learned that stutterings a part of me that makes me special
CHI: &-um it's when I don't speak as fluently
CHI: and it kind of helps me to get through tough situations because I have experience when &-um like in them so it helps in life to get put in things I probably wouldn't be able to if I didn't stutter
INV: &-um have you had speech therapy
CHI: yeah &-um so in my school there are &-um speech therapists who &-um work with kids who &-um pronounce sounds wrong and &-um stutter
CHI: so at first when I was in first grade &-um I started speech therapy for pronouncing the sound &+s and then that &-um kinda progressed into a stutter
INV: mhm
CHI: &-um so then from there and now I'm still in speech therapy
INV: is there anything you want to say to people who want to become speech therapists
CHI: &-um so a_lot_of speech therapists like are obsessed with &-um using tools
CHI: &-um and to me &-um once I like use a tool for like a year I almost get immune to it
CHI: and then &-um my speech therapist keeps ranting on about like I need to use my tools more often then I open up and say like they don't work anymore
CHI: she just kind of says that I need to practice them more and then they will work so do not use tools as like your main punch line
INV: mhm what could they do that would help you most
CHI: &-um I'd say that you can't cure a stutter just being there for like support if your colleague is in like a tough time you can support them mentally or &-um go up to a person that they're having trouble with and &-um educate them on stuttering
INV: okay thank you very much
