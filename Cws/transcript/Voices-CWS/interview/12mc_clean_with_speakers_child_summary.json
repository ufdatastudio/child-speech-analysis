  "summary": "I still stutter but I used to go to a place where I learned to deal with it. I've met friends here and we had lunch and saw a juggling person. My stutter started to get worse before Covid and it was hard for me to talk when I was a toddler. My stutter teacher helped me stop stuttering, but it's been getting worse again. I'm okay and I think it's fun and I want to help kids with stuttering.",
