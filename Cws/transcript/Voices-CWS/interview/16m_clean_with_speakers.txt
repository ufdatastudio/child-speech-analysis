INT: alright so the first thing I'd like to ask you is can you talk about the impact of stuttering on your daily life
INT: you can talk about interactions with family with friends school work community activities anything you want
CHI: I feel like when I was younger my stuttering kinda like kinda frustrated me and like people would make fun of me and I didn't really know how to deal with it but like I think like as I grew up I figured out I should just tell people like what it is and that I stutter and usually that will stop that person from saying anything else mean
CHI: and I think now I've like accept my stuttering and learned that it's okay
CHI: that was a big change learning to accept it and just you know it's okay and then I don't need to be completely fluent
INT: okay alright
INT: have you ever really thought much about what might cause stuttering
CHI: not really too much
CHI: maybe it's just like must be just something with the brain
CHI: but I'm not exactly sure what's the cause
CHI: it's a very good question
INT: I think we're a lot closer to figuring out what doesn't cause it than figuring out what does cause it
CHI: yeah
INT: yeah now if you've received any treatment therapy for stuttering in the past can you tell me about your therapy experiences and what the outcome of therapy was for you
CHI: I think mainly my therapy was just was learning was being taught like strategies to like help me through like the tough times and then like and at first through that I thought I wanted to come become completely fluent then I learned that then I learned through that that you don't need to be completely fluent
CHI: and just mainly my therapy has just been like learning new strategies like practicing and yeah that's the main
INT: okay
CHI: yeah
INT: okay sounds +/.
CHI: yeah I'm sure what else to say about that
INT: no it
INT: a_lot_of people say very much the same thing
CHI: yeah
INT: can you tell me what successful communication means to you and give an example of what you might consider to be a really positive communication experience
CHI: yeah I think successful communication isn't getting something out completely clean but now I think that it's i just successful communication I think i just getting out what you want to say
INT: okay I think that's good
INT: now here I think this could be harder
CHI: and +/.
INT: if you didn't stutter what do you think would be different about your life
CHI: I think maybe it would be easier to communicate with people but I don't think I would do much different
INT: okay alright
CHI: I think I've always been a little shy and maybe this stutter is part of that but maybe it's just part of who I am
INT: okay
CHI: just yeah
INT: so last question because it goes much faster than you'd think
CHI: yeah
INT: so if you had something that you wanted to say is there anything else that you would like to say to students who are training to be speech pathologists or just people in general that would help them learn about stuttering and ways to support people who stutter better
CHI: I think just I think they should focus on like what their clients just focus on like trying to like give them tools or advice on how to better deal with stuttering
CHI: and to not push anything that they wouldn't be comfortable with
INT: okay if you have can you give any examples is there something in particular that you feel that people might urge you to do that you wouldn't feel comfortable with
CHI: I don't know I haven't really been like forced much
CHI: I just think that would just be from what I've learned I think that that would just be a good word of advice to make clients feel that they are being treated as a true person and not as an issue with their stuttering as and treated as just a normal person with stuttering and just not to force anything
INT: I think that's nice
CHI: yeah
INT: I think that's good
INT: I'm going to stop the camera for a second
CHI: mhm
INT: and that's going to allow me to just +/.
