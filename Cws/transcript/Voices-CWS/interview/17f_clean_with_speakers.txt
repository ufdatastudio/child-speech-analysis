CHI: it's the same question
INV: I'll repeat it for you
CHI: okay
INV: tell me about some of the things you've been doing at the Friends convention so far
CHI: I've been hanging out with teens my age
CHI: I've been doing the advertisement thing
CHI: &-um I've been talking to older adults who stutter and like their experience
CHI: and pretty much that so far
INV: what else do you wanna do while you're here at the meeting
CHI: &-um I just wanna work on myself and like how I react to my stutter
CHI: I think
INV: awesome
INV: do you know why your family decided to come here
CHI: &-um because we went last year and it like really changed everything for myself and for my dad
CHI: so he wanted my mom to experience the same thing this year
INV: have you met any kids here
CHI: yeah I've met a lot
INV: what have you guys done or talked about
CHI: &-uh we played some really funny games last night we played a really intense game of spoons and musical chairs in a hotel room
INV: that's fun I'm a little jealous
INV: can you tell me about your talking
CHI: &-um like just my stutter or my talking in general
INV: whichever one you want
CHI: well most of the time I'm pretty fluent but when I do get into like really stressful situation or I'm really excited my stuttering tends to get worse
CHI: but it's usually okay most of the time
INV: okay
INV: can you tell me about times that it's easier and harder to talk
INV: I know you talked about it a little bit but
CHI: yeah
CHI: it's probably easier to talk when I'm with my family or my really close friends
CHI: and it's probably harder when I'm just really stressed about stuff
INV: okay what have you learned about stuttering
CHI: &-um that it's okay to have a stutter and that we're all different in a way and that we're all kind I guess connected in a way through it
CHI: and that there is like you can change because_of it I guess
INV: have you had speech therapy
CHI: yes
INV: is there anything you want to say to people who want to become speech therapists
CHI: &-um probably meet a few people who stutter
CHI: and like with other different speech impediments because it will probably help your patients feel better about their disability if you understand what they're going through
INV: yeah
CHI: mhm
INV: awesome
INV: what could they do that would help you most
CHI: just like speech pathologists in general
INV: yeah
CHI: probably just keep learning about it
INV: yeah awesome well thank you
