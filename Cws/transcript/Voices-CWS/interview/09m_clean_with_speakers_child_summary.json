  "summary": "I've been swimming and playing at night with my friends. I made a new handshake with some of my friends. My stutter is not huge, but it still happens sometimes. It's easier for me to speak on camera, but harder in big groups. I think therapy is good even if my stutter doesn't go away completely.",
