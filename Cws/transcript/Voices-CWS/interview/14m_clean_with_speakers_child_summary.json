  "summary": "I've been talking to my friends and it's been pretty fun. I usually stutter when I talk fast or I'm doing a presentation in front of a lot of people. It's usually hard to talk when I'm around a big group of people or I'm in like a crowd or I'm on a stage in front of people at school. I've learned about stuttering that some people do it and people who don't do it know about it and they usually have siblings friends or cousins who have it or they just learned it on their own. Usually what helps me the most is use a topic or play a game that's usually what I do with my speech pathologist.",
