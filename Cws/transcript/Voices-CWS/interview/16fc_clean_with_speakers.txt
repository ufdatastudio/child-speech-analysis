CHI: okay
INV: alright so tell me about some of the things you've been doing at Friends so far
CHI: &-um well I've been meeting all &-um new people I've been &-um doing the &-um workshops
CHI: &-uh I've been hanging out &-uh with &-um different groups
CHI: &-um we went &-uh out to &-uh dinner
CHI: &-um I &-um helped with &-uh raffle tickets
CHI: and just &-um &-uh &-uh &-um have been &-um trying to put myself out there &-um this conference
INV: yes that's so good and thank you for sharing
CHI: of course
INV: &-um what else do you want to do while you're here at Friends
CHI: while I'm here
INV: mhm
CHI: &-um I can't wait for &-uh &-uh &-um the &-um dance of course that's gonna be fun
CHI: &-um I want to do the karaoke too because &-uh that sounds so fun
CHI: &-um I wanna try and go swimming while we're here and then I want to &-um &-um try to &-uh &-uh &-um make sure &-um all the &-uh &-uh &-um people I've met &-um &-uh &-uh &-uh &-um we &-um try to stay in touch
INV: yes &-uh my next question is do you know why your family decided to come to Friends this year
CHI: &-um well my parents &-um my &-um mom &-uh &-uh &-um even though it's &-um a &-um stuttering &-um conference &-um she &-um also &-um loves the &-uh conferences and so &-um she goes &-uh &-uh &-um I want &-um to &-uh go too because it's just &-um the &-um atmosphere is &-um great &-um and &-um everyone &-um is always &-um so &-um welcoming
CHI: &-um so it's &-um really nice to come here and not &-um hafta &-uh worry about &-um what &-um people think
INV: exactly &-uh my next question for you is have you met &-um any of the kids here and what have you guys been doing or talked about
CHI: I have &-um &-um basically &-um we've been talking &-uh and sharing &-um our &-um stories &-um where we live &-um and then what &-uh we want to do &-um because we're all in &-um high school
CHI: and so &-um we've been talking about &-um about college &-um &-um being online &-um &-um with &-um social media and &-um just &-um just &-um getting to know &-um one another
INV: right &-um so my next question is can you tell me about your talking or just the way you speak in general
CHI: &-um I think &-uh my talking is sometimes more &-um stuttery@c &-uh in &-um different situations
CHI: &-um so &-like &-uh during &-um presentations I have &-uh a &-um hard time and so &-um &-um &-um my &-um teachers &-um understand that and so they will either &-um let me just &-um present &-um to &-um them &-um or after school
CHI: &-um but &-uh I have found over the &-um past year and &-uh &-um I was doing online school &-um it's kind of harder to speak online because &-um people hafta listen &-um more_so &-um than &-um in person kind of
CHI: &-um and so that's &-um been &-um interesting &-uh but &-um &-um &-um my speech &-um has gotten &-um both better &-um and worse &-um over &-um over time &-uh and &-um coming here has &-um hasn't always helped me
INV: yes thank you for sharing
CHI: of course
INV: my next question is can you tell me about the times &-um when it's easier or harder for you to talk
CHI: yeah &-um &-um it's &-um easier &-um to &-um talk with people I know and &-uh and &-um people I feel &-um feel &-um safe with &-um like &-um you guys because you're here and &-um &-um and so &-um people I won't mind letting my &-um my &-um guard down with
CHI: and it's harder to talk &-um with &-um strangers &-uh or &-um people I know don't &-um don't &-um really care &-um and with &-um presentations and &-um in front of groups of people who &-um &-um don't &-um listen as_well_as others do
INV: right thank you so much for sharing
CHI: of course
INV: &-um so what have you learned about stuttering so far in your life or just in general
CHI: &-um I've learned that one I'm not &-um the &-um only one &-um who stutters &-um as &-um most people &-um who stutter think &-um think that they're the &-uh only one
CHI: &-uh and I've learned &-uh a &-um lot a &-um lot &-um from Name &-um because she was &-um my speech &-um therapist &-uh at &-um one time
CHI: &-um and I have different people &-um &-um I've had &-um different people &-um teach me different ways but &-um &-um my &-um favorite &-um person is &-um Name &-um Name because &-um when I talk to her &-um she &-um doesn't &-um tell me to &-um &-um use tools &-um or &-uh slow down or &-um how to speak &-um she &-um lets me say &-um what I &-um hafta say
CHI: and &-um and &-um tries to find &-um what will &-um be &-um easier &-um to &-um help me based off what I need
INV: right right &-um and my last question is have you had speech therapy and is there anything you like &-um people to know about &-um stuttering
CHI: I have had &-um speech therapy I believe for &-um for &-um six or seven years
CHI: &-um I don't really do it now &-um but &-um with &-um with &-um stuttering you can't rush it because &-um most people &-um who stutter &-uh &-um it will make it worse
CHI: because being told &-um to &-um slow down and &-um take &-um &-um deep breaths is &-um is &-um nerve-wracking
CHI: and so &-um I think it's just try and find out what that person needs by &-um listening to them and &-um what's &-um worked for them and &-um what hasn't and &-um try to be &-um supportive &-um even if it's hard for them
INV: yes and that concludes our interview
CHI: okay
