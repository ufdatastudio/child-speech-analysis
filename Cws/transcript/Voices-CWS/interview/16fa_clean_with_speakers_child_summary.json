  "summary": "I've been to the friends convention five times and I'm looking forward to meeting new people who stutter. My stutter is unpredictable and can be very hard to understand me at times. I don't know what my stutter will be like from day to day, it's like a game. I'm nervous when I'm in new positions and my stutter gets worse. I've learned that it's okay to stutter and it makes me who I am.",
  "quotes": [
    "it's like I stutter &-um like very minor in some days",
    "it's okay to stutter because unfortunately in this society people often think that just because you talk differently that something is wrong with you"
