  "summary": "I've been talking to speech therapists about what they should do with their colleagues. I'd like to learn more about stuttering itself because no one exactly knows what it is. I've been coming to this place for a long time and it's helped me boost my confidence. My stutter is characterized by repetition and blocks, and it's not as clear and fluent as others. I've learned that stuttering is a part of me that makes me special and helps me get through tough situations.",

    "stuttering is just like a part of me that makes me special",
