  "summary": "I've been hanging out with a group of teens and it's been fun. I want to make more friends and I've met some good friends at a friends meeting in Indianapolis. My stuttering was worse in elementary school but it's getting better now. It's easier to talk when I'm calm and know someone better, but harder when I'm stressed out. I'm taking speech therapy, but it's just teaching me tricks, not a permanent fix.",
  "quotes": [
    "it's not my fault it's just like mainly one percent of one hundred percent of people stutter",
    "just listen to what like I want and like how I want to grow and stuff"
