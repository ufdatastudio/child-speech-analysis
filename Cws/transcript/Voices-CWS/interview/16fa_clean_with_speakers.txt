INV: ready
INV: okay so tell me about some of the things you've been doing at the friends convention so far
INV: what else do you want to do while you're here at the convention
CHI: &-um so far at the friends convention I've went to some workshops here and &-um I'm looking forward to meeting new people who stutter as well so yeah
INV: awesome do you know why your family decided to come here
CHI: my speech therapist Dana had &-um told us about friends a few years ago
CHI: so this is my fifth time at friends so yeah
INV: have you met any kids here
INV: what have you done or talked about
CHI: &-um I've met some kids here &-um I was recommended to talk to the new people at friends
CHI: so I just like talked about what their experience was so far how they like it and all that so yeah
INV: so can you tell me about your talking
CHI: yeah &-um so my stutter is pretty much like unpredictable
CHI: it's like I stutter &-um like very minor in some days
CHI: but like I also have my days where it's very &-um it's not really it's my stutter is just like very hard to assume what it's gonna be like
CHI: and it's sometimes it can be very rapid or like very disfluent and all that
CHI: and it can be hard to understand me
CHI: but &-um I just don't know so it's kinda like a game
CHI: because like I don't know like if I'll stutter you_know as much or if I stutter a lot I just don't know
CHI: so that's what I think of it as so yeah
INV: Kind of similar but can you tell me about the times that it's easier and harder to talk
CHI: &-um when I'm but into new &-um new positions where like I'm not familiar in
CHI: and &-um my stutter really happens when I'm like very nervous
CHI: and when I'm nervous is when my stutter is like very disfluent
CHI: and so I just like don't ever know what it's gonna be like but like for example for like presentations I'll stutter more than I'm used to
CHI: but it's all because_of my nerves so that's why
INV: yeah
CHI: mhm
INV: so what have you learned about stuttering
CHI: I well over time I've learned that it's okay to stutter because unfortunately in this society people often think that just because you talk differently that something is wrong with you
CHI: and you hafta change it but really it's just it makes you for who you are and so it's not an overnight process and acceptance took me like years
CHI: and &-um I've finally come to a place where I'm accepting of my stutter so
CHI: yeah
INV: okay and last question have you had speech therapy
INV: is there anything you'd like to say to people who want to become speech therapists
INV: what could they do that would help you the most
CHI: I have &-um attended speech therapy probably ever since I could talk
CHI: but I never really had a speech therapist who really knew about stuttering and like in the past I've had therapists that would come with strategies to like change it
CHI: or fix it and the thing is that stuttering does not hafta be fixed at all
CHI: but &-um over time I met my good speech therapist Dana whose very educated on stuttering
CHI: so if you're a speech therapist I would recommend you really research &-um about stuttering and know that people like me can be comfortable
CHI: and &-um yeah that's pretty much it I'm just talking so
INV: no +...
CHI: I love to talk so sorry
INV: we love that
