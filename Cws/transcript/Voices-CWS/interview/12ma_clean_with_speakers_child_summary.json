  "summary": "I want to meet other kids who stutter and learn about their experiences. Stuttering can come in different shapes and sizes, and it can be short or long. I've learned some strategies to help with stuttering, like relaxation and taking my time. It can be hard to talk when I'm stressed or feeling watched, but when I'm relaxed, it's easier. I think being patient and understanding is important for kids who stutter.",
  "quotes": [
    "I stutter sometimes and sometimes it's just a quick little like &-um &+I like that and I can fix it",
    "I'd say relax be patient and when they are coming to a sentence and they would like help or saying something you could help them work it out"
