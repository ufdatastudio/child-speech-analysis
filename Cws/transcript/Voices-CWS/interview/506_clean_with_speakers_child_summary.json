  "summary": "I've been listening in on panels and going to the teens group to meet new people. I'd like to go to the teen hospitality room to talk with everyone more. I usually ask my parents if we can come to the meeting, and this year it was easy because we visited family in New York first. I've met a lot of new people here, but we haven't done much except talk and do group activities. It's easier to talk with people I know in comfortable situations, but harder with newer people or during presentations.",
  "quotes": [
    "I'd say with stuttering specifically it's a lot kind of worse than normal",
    "they could probably just give me the time to talk and not try to be forceful with tools"
