  "summary": "I've done fun activities like juggling and eating Skittles at friends. I saw posters about this place at my speech therapist's waiting room and thought it would be cool to come with my friend. I stutter a little bit but I don't notice it often and I'm fine with it. It's normally easier to talk, but sometimes I get a block and it's hard. I've learned about the three types of stuttering and stuff.",
