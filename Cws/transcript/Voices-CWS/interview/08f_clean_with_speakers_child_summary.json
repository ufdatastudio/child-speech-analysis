  "summary": "I like advertising because I get to talk to people about anything I want. It's brave to tell people I stutter and it might take me a little while to talk. Most people react really well and are kind when they find out I stutter. I want to learn to be more accepting of my stutter and it's a part of me. I think it's good and bad, but it makes me unique and special.",
