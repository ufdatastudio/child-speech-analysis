INV: tell me about some of the things you've been doing at the event or Friends meeting so far and what else you want to do while you're here
PAR: um well
PAR: I've been
PAR: hanging out with um all my friends that I've met at then convention is fun
PAR: um and then
PAR: and I've also been &-um attending a lot of like a lot of the sessions um and and the panels and the open mics um really just kind of sp:ending time with people and the stuttering community
PAR: um and I don't know I think while I'm here
PAR: I wanna um ah get away from my comfort zone a little bit but
PAR: you know speaking to more people or speaking on stage cause I feel like if I'm gonna do it anywhere it'll be here
INV: nice
INV: well I look forward to it I hope I hope to see you up there
PAR: I don't know we'll see
INV: yeah
INV: alright number two is
INV: do you know why your family decided to come to Friends
PAR: um well well we've been coming for I think just about seven years now
PAR: um so we have come because it you know it's been I'm sure everyone's been talking about this but it's been like such an impactful experience
PAR: for us and like and like such a great community um and I've met you know so many friends here and there's really a difference of talking to people at this conventions versus like out in daily life I don't even like realize it until I come here and there's like a lot of kind of relief and relaxation versus like the um the usual stress that comes with talking to anyone
PAR: outside of here
INV: yeah it's a really great community
PAR: okay our next question is um
INV: have you met any other teens or kids your age here and what have you been doing or talking about
PAR: um yes tons
PAR: um I've met lots of people
PAR: throughout the years um
PAR: lots of returning faces but also I feel like every time I come there's new people so that's always exciting
PAR: um we kind of I mean we'll talk about like random teenager things but also you know like shared experiences when it comes to like school and like stuttering and teachers um and kind of how we deal with that
PAR: .
INV: yeah it's nice to balance those experiences off of people
INV: okay our next question is can you tell me about your speech
PAR: um okay yeah
PAR: yeah I'm trying to think
PAR: that's pretty yeah
PAR: pretty open ended
PAR: very broad yeah
PAR: but um I don't think I don't have that severe of a stutter ah I don't know if it like borders on like mild to intermediate um
PAR: but I think as everyone's it gets worse when um when I'm like really excited or really nervous
PAR: um but I don't necessarily like use these speech strategies now
PAR: um to like try and cover it up um but I used to but even like if I don't try and cover it up um
PAR: then I always like worry around like talking to people and how will they perceive it
PAR: um and that's kind of always a little nerve wracking
INV: hmm yeah
INV: thank you for sharing about that even though it's rough
PAR: okay I have three more questions for you
INV: so can you tell me about a time or times where it's easier and harder for you to talk
PAR: um yeah definitely like easier with friends or with family and with other pe:ople who stutter
PAR: um and higher around when first meeting people um when I'm like really excited or really nervous
PAR: or I have to do like a presentation &-um
PAR: or if I have to like speak in other language
PAR: um those are kind of all the times when it's harder there's kind of that like underlying like worry about it
PAR: um but yeah when I'm here that like completely goes away really so it's kind of it's it's still like a novelty each year to like feel the difference like oh wow I was you know thinking about it a lot when I'm not here um and then kind of only notice that when I'm here so
INV: okay
INV: that's nice to hear
INV: alright
INV: so what have you learned about stuttering
INV: another broad one
PAR: no I feel like um what really comes to mind I just learned like last year at the last convention um at one of the other tables that um that stuttering is a neurological disorder
PAR: actually didn't know that before
PAR: um and now I've like learned that I've read some you know book about that too
PAR: it's really interesting cause like for a while it was when I was doing speech therapy too they kind of talk like about like things happening like in your in your vocal cords and I was told like how can we like fix this physically but um so I was really kind of surprised to hear that that it's um neurological
PAR: happening in your brain
PAR: ah but they're really not like sure they're really not like sure what's happening in the brain
PAR: it's just something is happening
PAR: which then leads to like this stutter so that was that was a big revelation
INV: yeah
PAR: for me
INV: yeah
INV: it's one of those things where there's always new things to discover
INV: so that's really interesting
INV: alright here's our last question it's kind of a two parter
INV: so the first part is have you had speech therapy and the second is is there anything you'd like to say to people who want to become speech therapists that um would help them with how they can help you most
PAR: yes so yes
PAR: I've done many years oh speech therapy
PAR: not in the last like two years
PAR: ah but but like for a while
PAR: &-um and it started off as most people would say I'm sure
PAR: as as being like mostly about fluency now it's kind of begun to be mostly about acceptance which I think is awesome
PAR: I can tell you know that for like really what what I liked about my last speech therapist is she would always check in with me every couple of months and ask me kind of what what my goals were for therapy and what I wanted to get out of it um and how much of it was like fluency versus acceptance and the two kind of can can also bleed together a little bit
PAR: so I really like that it was very that I felt like that I was in control of it and could get out what I wanted
PAR: um so I felt like that was kind of a huge part of it
PAR: and she and she always encouraged me to disclose even though I never really did cause that's very scary
PAR: um but if like you know there was no pressure to like be fluent or have that be the end goal I think that's really important I think the big there's really kind of a negative connotation with speech therapy now that that like that means that you're tying to be fluent and kind of and get get rid of this like flaw but I don't think about it like that
PAR: that has to be the uh the direction that has to go in so um
PAR: but yeah I also feel like I don't know what they're teaching this year anymore um but it used to be all about like you like like out your hands here and it's the popsicle stick &-uh I think that like now that's that's not encouraged cause that clearly isn't what's wrong but um
PAR: but I was like that's some weird weird things
PAR: um but yeah also just kind of playing lots of games you know doing creating that relationship that relationship has been really helpful for me
