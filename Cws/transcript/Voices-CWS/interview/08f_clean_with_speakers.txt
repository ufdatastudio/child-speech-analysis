INT: okay tell me about some of the things you've been doing at Friends so far
CHI: okay well like we've been &-um advertising
CHI: &-um which is a great &-um experience cause &-like you get to &-like talk to people about &-like and anything &-like just asking them &-like a question but &-like having the courage to like go up to them
CHI: &-um we've been &-like telling them &-like hey I &-um stutter &-so &-like it might take me a little while to &-um talk
CHI: &-like telling them that is really brave
CHI: &-so we'd &-so we would do that
CHI: which is a_lot_of fun
CHI: &-um and &-like and it and I also &-like think &-like people have obvious terrible expectations
CHI: where &-like people will &-like react horribly
CHI: but &-like most of the time &-like &-um &-like everyone reacts really well
CHI: and is really kind and nice about it
CHI: &-so that's what we did yesterday at the Friends conference
INT: cool
CHI: yeah
INT: that's great to hear about
INT: what else do you wanna do while you're here
CHI: while I'm here well &-um &-well I kind of want to &-um learn to be more accepting of my stutter and &-like &-um kind of learning it's a part of me
CHI: and I can make it better but it won't &-like completely go away
CHI: &-so I just kind of but that'll definitely take time &-so +...
INT: yeah
INT: do you know why your family decided to come
CHI: &-um &+ye I mean I have an idea
CHI: possibly &-um is because &-like they haven't met anyone else &-wh like me or you know who stutters at all
CHI: and &-so &-like they want a chance to &-um meet all of these other people and &-um just kind of &-like learning more about what it is and how it works from people &-like who actually research it and who have a stutter
CHI: &-so yeah
INT: good
INT: have you met any kids here I know you have
CHI: yes
CHI: yes I have
CHI: &-um yes a couple of kids
CHI: &-um yeah
CHI: I met a couple of them
INT: yeah
INT: and +/.
INT: what have you guys done together
CHI: I mean &-like we don't really talk about it that much I mean we kinda just do what kids do
CHI: run around the hotel playing tag and hide and seek but so +...
INT: can you tell me about your talking
CHI: yes I mean &-well that's a very broad topic I think but like you know there's a bad part of it and there's a good part of it
CHI: &-like the bad part you know is obviously &-like just really annoying and &-like I just you know &-like I just wanna get my words out and I can't some of the time &-um
CHI: but then on the other side it can be good because &-like it led me here you know to the Friends conference and to meeting all of these other people
CHI: and &-like it just and &-like you know it's and it makes me unique and also special
CHI: &-um &-so you know but it's kind of a it's a good and bad I would say
INT: mhm
INT: can you tell me about times when it's easier and harder to talk
CHI: I mean well I mean &-like harder is the easier one to &-um talk about
CHI: &-like harder is definitely when I'm excited or &-um &-like when I'm meeting new people or &-um adults and &-like even I know &-like during school &-like presentations or when you hafta &-like go in front of &-like a green screen or camera but
CHI: &-um it's easier when I'm talking with my parents or my friends &-um or my brother
CHI: and &-like you know it's easier &-like obviously to kind of &-like say &-like a couple of words not &-like huge long sentences
CHI: &-um and when I'm also &-like when I'm &-um yelling I kind of I find it easier to talk more fluently
CHI: &-so yeah that's interesting but +...
INT: have you had speech therapy
CHI: yes
INT: is there anything you'd like to say to people who want to become speech therapists
CHI: I mean there's not much actually
CHI: but &-like but I think what they do well is &-like giving me &-like the options
CHI: and &-like here's one way you can you know &-like on an every day basis &-like have more fluent speech
CHI: &-um and &-like if that's not work &-like here's a different &-like here's other way you know &-like &-so I think they have a good idea of all of the options
CHI: you can &-like and just &-like try this or try this &-so you know I think that's good but yeah
INT: and what could they do that would help you the most
CHI: what they could do to help me the most I mean +...
INT: if there's anything different than what you just said
CHI: &-um I don't think that I that there's too much that's different
CHI: I mean I think it's just &-like I don't know I mean yeah and giving me those options &-like I said
CHI: and I mean &-like that but &-like teaching me &-like how to talk to a person about it
CHI: or &-like you know &-like how to react when a person mentions it
CHI: but other than that you know +...
INT: very nice thank you
