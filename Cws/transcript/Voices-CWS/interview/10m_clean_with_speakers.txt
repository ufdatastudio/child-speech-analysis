CHI: &-um make more friends who have a stutter
INV: very good
INV: do you know why your family decided to come here
CHI: &-um I think they decided for me to come here since I have not made a friends that has a stutter my whole entire life

INV: the Nike store
CHI: mhm
INV: and what have you guys talked about
CHI: &-um it's okay if you stutter &-um since it's a good thing kind of if you stutter since if you &-um like camp and you stutter
CHI: &-um you could go to more camps
INV: oh cool
INV: you could go to camps with other kids who stutter
CHI: mhm
INV: cool
INV: &-um can you tell me about your talking
CHI: &-um I've had a stutter since I was like five maybe and I'm ten right now
INV: mhm
CHI: &-um and I went to speech therapy at like three maybe
INV: okay
INV: and can you tell me about times that it's easier or harder to talk
CHI: &-um so when I was in third grade I had to do a presentation and I chose Babe Ruth to do
CHI: sorry I like the Yankees too
INV: alright
CHI: and the Cubs
INV: so you chose Babe Ruth
CHI: yeah
INV: because you're a fan okay
CHI: &-um and I had to tell my whole class about it &-um and to all the parents like so they would just come and I would just talk to them about the thing
CHI: or they would just say could you tell a couple of facts about &-um your &-um Babe Ruth poster
INV: mhm
INV: so was that I time when it was harder to talk or easier to talk or
CHI: &-um the first five times I did it it was like kinda hard &-um but the other times I did it &-um it was super easy
CHI: so I think that I &-um like one on one maybe since like a class is fine
CHI: and I like when I can talk in a big group of people so
