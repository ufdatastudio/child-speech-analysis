INV: okay ready
INV: okay tell me about some of the things you've been doing at the friends meeting so far
INV: I know you just got here but +...
CHI: yeah
INV: &-um and then you can also tell me what else you wanna do while you're here
CHI: well I wanna meet more kids here and see where they're from and how they've been stuttering and how they've been getting through basically and what is happening
CHI: and I've learned that it's kinda an odd comment but &-um stuttering can come in all shapes and sizes
INV: mhm cool
CHI: some things are little to like a really long thing which is interesting
INV: &-uh have you done any activities yet
CHI: &-um not really we have done some games &-um but it didn't really involve stuttering
INV: okay what kinda games were they
CHI: well we did this one where we would have this detective and we had this one person that was it
CHI: and they would do this one pattern and everybody would start doing this and then they would switch it
CHI: like you_know and when they would do that people would follow them
CHI: and the detective had to find the person who was it
INV: oh cool
CHI: it was a good strategy game
CHI: and we did some icebreakers in there and we did two truths and a lie
INV: mhm do you know why your family decided to come here
CHI: well for the reason why I wanted to come here is so_that I could meet other kids who stutter
CHI: and so I could know like you've been through this pain so have I it's annoying and that
INV: cool &-um have you met any kids here
CHI: well yeah in our groups
INV: &-um and what have you you told me a little bit about what you've done
INV: is there anything else you've done with the other kids
CHI: well mostly just mainly talked a lot
INV: okay
CHI: just talked about what where we've been why we came here and it's interesting
INV: cool
INV: &-um can you tell me about your talking
CHI: well I stutter sometimes and sometimes it's just a quick little like &-um &+I like that and I can fix it
CHI: but if sometimes if it's long then I usually go like blah or something like that
CHI: it just loosens up my throat so then I can talk easier which is nice
INV: mhm &-um can you tell me about the times when it's easier to talk
CHI: when I feel like I'm more relaxed because I know when you relax your throat you can talk easier because my mom says you need timing and relaxation for it to for you to be able to not stutter as much
CHI: and sometimes it can be hard and sometimes it can be very easy if I'm just relaxed and having a good time and not paying attention to what's happening and paying attention to my friends there
INV: can you tell me about the times that it's harder to stutter
CHI: when I feel a little more stressed and I'm like people are watching me a lot I don't like this ah that and then I start to feel like more like that and it's kinda hard sometimes
INV: &-uh what have you learned about stuttering
CHI: well again like I said stuttering can come in all shapes and sizes and &-um it can be short it can be long
CHI: sometimes you don't even know you're stuttering and sometimes you know you're stuttering
CHI: so it's interesting
INV: &-uh have you had speech therapy
CHI: I think I had once but I don't think it was really speech therapy in a way
INV: okay
CHI: like they talked about my stuttering and how I feel about it and some stuff I can do
INV: hm okay
CHI: so I wouldn't really call it speech therapy but something kinda like it
INV: okay so it was some kind of treatment related to speech therapy
CHI: in a way but it didn't help
INV: mhm
CHI: like nothing helps
CHI: they say if you talk like a robot it might help you I'm like no it doesn't help you
CHI: like I've seen people here who are thirty five and they've done that and they still stutter
CHI: it doesn't help
INV: is there anything you'd like to say to people who want to become speech therapists
CHI: try to go easy on the kids and if they are trying to work on a sentence don't be like well what like don't keep on talking like forcing them it will give them well for me it will get me more stress and then I can't speak even more
CHI: and so I'd be like and then I would get it out
CHI: and that would happen and I would tell them like also be patient for kids who stutter
CHI: and &-um just also help kids who would like help which is very useful
INV: &-um what could they do that would help you the most
CHI: sorry could you repeat that
INV: yeah so what could they meaning the future speech therapists what could they do that would help you most
CHI: help me
CHI: okay &-um
CHI: like I said again be patient and don't be like come on what that can stress you out more and then get like oh I don't know and that can be a little annoying
CHI: I'd say relax be patient and when they are coming to a sentence and they would like help or saying something you could help them work it out and be like you_know relax make sure your throat is just opened up and not tight like an not squeezed inside
CHI: because I know my mom says like this like when you're pushing your hands you can't move them that well but if you relax you can do this so it's easier
INV: great
CHI: alright
