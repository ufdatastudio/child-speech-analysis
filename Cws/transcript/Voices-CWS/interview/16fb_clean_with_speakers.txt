INV: &-so I'm just going to ask you these questions and then afterwards we're going to have you read something and then
CHI: okay
INV: yeah
INV: okay tell me about some of the things you've been doing at the friends conference so far
CHI: &-uh I've been meeting a_lot_of other kids my age who stutter and I've been going to workshops and outings where we're at
INV: cool
INV: &-uh what else do you want to do while you're here
CHI: &-um I definitely want to make some more connections with people my own age cause I don't really have that with people who stutter back home
CHI: &-uh &-so just getting some closer connections
INV: mhm
INV: will you stay in touch
CHI: yeah totally
INV: cool
INV: &-uh do you know why your family decided to come here
CHI: &-uh yeah &-uh me and my mom were kind of at an impasse where she didn't know how to help me and didn't necessarily know how I wanted to be helped
CHI: &-um &-so we were just looking for all kinds of resources to help us both navigate that time
INV: &-um have you you have met some kids here
INV: what have you done together
CHI: &-uh we've gone to workshops together
CHI: and like last night we all hung out at the hotel and played some games
INV: oh okay
INV: and &-uh and what kinds of things have you talked about
CHI: &-um a_lot_of what we've talked about when we just hang out is just normal stuff
CHI: which is kind of refreshing when you're in a very emotional charged environment like this is to just have some normal conversation but in the under what we all have an underlying understanding of what each of us is going through and it's alright to leave that unspoken cause we all know that we understand it
INV: mhm
INV: &-uh can you tell me about your talking
CHI: &-uh I stutter a decent amount like of course I've met all sorts of people who have different variaties of fluency rates
CHI: &-um I don't know that's all I can say
INV: alright
INV: &-um can you tell me about times that it's easier and harder to talk
CHI: &-uh it's definitely easier to talk when I'm in a not stressful situation with people I know and I'm comfortable with
CHI: &-um and when I can keep myself in a chill kind a mood I can usually get by pretty easy but when I'm in a more stressful situation &-um obviously my fluency rate goes a little downward
INV: mhm
INV: &-uh what have you learned about stuttering
CHI: &-um I've learned that no people stutter the same way
CHI: which was very interesting for me before I met anyone else who stuttered
CHI: &-um and I've learned that everyone reacts and copes with it in a different way
INV: interesting how did you learn that
CHI: &-uh just by talking to other people who stutter
CHI: back home I there's only an adult chapter of the National_Stuttering_Association so of course I'd met a couple other people who stutter but we couldn't really connect in the same way that I can connect with people here
INV: mhm
INV: &-um have you had speech therapy
CHI: yes I saw a private speech therapist when I was in preschool for about two years
CHI: and then when I gotta kindergarten I saw one through school up until third grade when they discontinued my I@l E@l P@l much to my mother's not very appreciativeness@c
CHI: &-um and then my fluency rate went down throughout the years until we hit a breaking point in about seventh grade where we were just having a really bad time with one of my teachers who was giving me bad grades on my presentations for things that I could not control
CHI: &-um and it was just not helping myself esteem at all
CHI: &-so &-uh my parents sent me there with the intention to raise my fluency rate and therefore raise my self confidence
CHI: and that's what it started off with but the speech therapist I saw was really nice
CHI: and she more so focused on &-um acceptance and embracing
CHI: and she helped me get connected all these types of different communities that I'm involved with now
CHI: &-um and I don't see one anymore
CHI: I stopped right before my freshman year of high school
CHI: &-um I don't think I'll ever go see one again just cause I don't necessarily feel I need it anymore
CHI: I'm comfortable with where I'm at I feel like
INV: &-um is there anything you'd like to say to people who want to become speech therapists
CHI: &-um involve yourself in organizations such as this that definitely more focus on embracing and acceptance and self advocacy so_that you know how to best help the new generation of people who stutter
CHI: because we really want to raise as many as we can in an environment like this where they don't feel like they hafta change to fit anyone's idea of what normal is
CHI: &-um and I know had I had a speech therapist who had been &-um exposed to an environment like this I probably would have had a much easier time though elementary and middle school
INV: mhm
INV: &-um what could they do that would help you most
INV: speech therapists
CHI: &-um talk to your kid about what their goals are
CHI: of course like you hafta involve parents and all that but make sure the kids on board with what you trying to do
CHI: cause if the kid doesn't really care what their fluency rate is then there's no point in putting them through the stress and the &-um self loathing that sometimes fluency goal based speech therapy can impose
INV: mhm
