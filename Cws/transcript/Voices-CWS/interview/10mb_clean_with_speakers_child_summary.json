  "summary": "I played a ton of games and drew a ton of stuff at the friends meeting. I want to do the same things because it's been really fun. I met a kid named Henry and we like talking about sports. My talking is like bumpy and sometimes it's hard to get through, like when there are locks blocking my door. It's easier to talk when I'm not in a huge group and I'm not thinking about it.",
  "quotes": [
    "it's like really not that bad to stutter, like it's just cool to stutter like it's different",
    "just let them talk and just like don't feel in for them"
