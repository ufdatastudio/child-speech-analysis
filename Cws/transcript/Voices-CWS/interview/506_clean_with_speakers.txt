PAR: &-um I going to the teens group and trying to put myself out there more with newer people
PAR: and &-um trying to get out_of the the &-um comfort zone that I have
PAR: &-um I would &-um like to go to a &-um the &-um teen &-um hospitality room to try to talk talk with &-um everyone more
INV: okay
INV: &-um do you know why your family decided to come here
PAR: &-um I usually ask my parents if &-um we can come

INV: mhm
INV: cool

PAR: &-um that's kinda been it
PAR: &=laughs
PAR: that's kinda been it
INV: &-um can you tell me about your talking
PAR: &-um I'd say &+m with stuttering specifically it &-um right now it's &-um a lot kind of worse than &-um normal

INV: mhm
INV: can you tell me about times that's easier and harder to talk
PAR: &-um it's it easier talk with people I know in &-um comfortable in &-um &-um situations &-um
PAR: and it is harder to talk with newer people or &-um during presentations
INV: mm
INV: &-um what have you learned about stuttering
PAR: &-um I've &-um learned that it's not really something can be stopped
PAR: there tools and methods that can &-um maybe make it all slightly &-um easier
PAR: but &-um but it's all different for everyone
PAR: so it's not always the same
INV: okay
PAR: and have you had any speech therapy
PAR: and if so is there anything you'd like to say to people who want to become a speech therapist
PAR: and what could they do that would help you the most
PAR: &-um I have gone to speech therapy
PAR: &-um I'd say &-um what helped me the &-um most &-um was &-um &-um was &-um just being able to talk
PAR: &-um I'm trying to find solutions to make situations better based on how I'm reacting to different things
PAR: &-um what was the &-um third question
INV: yep
INV: it was what could they do that would help you the most
PAR: &-um they could probably just give me the time to talk
PAR: &-um and not try to be forceful with &-uh tools because in my experience I know this isn't everyone's &-uh but tools don't really &-um work for all me &-um
PAR: and just try to be someone who's understand and will listen
INV: yeah great
INV: well that that's it for the questions so thank you
