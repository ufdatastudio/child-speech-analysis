INV: awesome do you know why your family decided to come here
CHI: &-um my family decided to come here because we came here seven years ago

CHI: I would say my talking is pretty good
CHI: I usually stutter when I talk fast or I'm doing a presentation infront of a_lot_of people
INV: okay can you tell me about the times that it's easier and harder to talk
CHI: the times that are easier to talk is usually infront of my family or my friends from friends
CHI: it's usually hard to talk when I'm around a big group of people or I'm in like a crowd or I'm on a stage infront of people at school
INV: what have you learned about stuttering
CHI: I've learned about stuttering that some people do it and people who don't do it know about it and they usually have siblings friends or cousins who have it or they just learned it on their own
INV: have you had speech therapy
CHI: yes I have had speech therapy with my great speech pathologist I will not say her name but she's pretty good
INV: is there anything you want to say to people who want to become speech therapists
CHI: &-um I would say that you should let the kids who usually stutter a lot more to let them take their time you shouldn't say it because that's worse but you should let them talk
CHI: you should let them get their words out
CHI: give new strategies to let the words come out fluency and better
INV: what could they do that would help them the most
CHI: &-um usually what helps me the most is use a topic or play a game that's usually what I do with my speech pathologist
CHI: we usually play games or talk about stuff we're interested in
CHI: and it usually helps me talk more and better so I usually don't stutter a lot when we talk about stuff that I'm interested in and it distracts me from my stuttering usually
INV: okay
