CHI: It had been a hard on on Alice to live in a lonely castle so far from the city
CHI: tonight it was even harder because the storm frighten her
CHI: it's not even a good night for ghosts she thought
CHI: she put some more firewood wood into the fire
CHI: she knew she was only fooling herself
CHI: she knew the ghost would be in the chapel again tonight
CHI: she had seen it every night since she had moved into the castle
CHI: she went to the large window and slowly moved the curtain apart apart
CHI: she could see the chapel downhill
CHI: a flashing lightning lit the sky for a moment
CHI: she looked out again
CHI: this this time she saw the glow
CHI: coming from the chapel
CHI: her ghost was waiting
