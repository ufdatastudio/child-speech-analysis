CHI: It had been very hard on Alice to live in a lonely castle so far from the city
CHI: tonight it was even harder because the storm frightened her
CHI: It's not even a good night for ghosts she she thought
CHI: she put some more firewood into the fire
CHI: she knew she was only fooling herself
CHI: she knew the ghost would be in the chapel again tonight
CHI: she had seen it every night since she had moved into the castle
CHI: she went to the large window and slowly moved the curtain apart
CHI: she could see the chapel down the hill
CHI: a flash lightning lit the sky for a moment
CHI: she looked out again this time she saw the glow coming from the chapel
CHI: her her ghost was waiting
