CHI: so here we are in Friuli
CHI: tucked away in a remote corner of the Alpine foothills in Northeastern Italy
CHI: at a little restaurant
CHI: I hafta admit that when I travel history is not the first thing on my mind
CHI: food and wine are
CHI: and that's what sold me on Friuli
CHI: it is famous as a source of some Italy's best white wines
CHI: we went primarily in search of wines on where unaware that we soon would make a culinary detour
CHI: occupying the extreme northeast corner of Italy
CHI: Friuli scenery ranges from rugged coastline along the eastern border to placid plains in the west and the majestic Alps in the north
CHI: where Italy butts up against Austria
CHI: directly to the south of Venice just a little more than an hour and a half way
CHI: through off the beaten tourist track
CHI: Friuli is hard in the path of history
CHI: standing at one one of the major crossroads between western Europe and the east
CHI: it was conquered by just about everyone who passed by
CHI: as a result things look different here
CHI: but other than the familiar cultural overlay of most of Italy
CHI: the central European influence is readily apparent in Friuli
CHI: the architecture tends more toward Autrailian grandeur than Tuscan simplicity
CHI: here you'll find gray stone castles rather than sun drenched villas
CHI: the people look different too
CHI: taller and blonder and the than southern Italians and with plenty of German and central European surnames
