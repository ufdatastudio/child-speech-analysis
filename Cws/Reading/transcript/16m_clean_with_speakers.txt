CHI: So here we are in Friuli
CHI: tucked away in a remote corner of the alpine foothills in northeastern Italy
CHI: at at a little restaurant
CHI: I hafta admit that when I travel history is not the first thing on my mind
CHI: food food and and wine are
CHI: and that's what sold me on Friuli
CHI: it is famous as source of some of Italy's best white wines
CHI: we went primarily in search of wines unware that we soon would make a culinary detour
CHI: occupying the the extreme northeast corner of Italy Friuli's scenery ranges from rugged coastline along the eastern border to placid plains in the west and the majestic Alps in the north
CHI: where Italy butts up against Austria
CHI: directly to the south is Venice just a little more than a half half an hour oh than more than an hour and a half away
CHI: though off the beaten tourist track Friuli is hard in the path of history
CHI: standing at one of the major crossroads between western Europe and the east it was conquered by just about everyone who passed by
CHI: as a result things look different here rather than the familiar cultural overlay of most of Italy the central european influence is readily apparent in Friuli
CHI: the architecture tends more more toward Austrian grandeur than Tuscan simplicity
CHI: here you'll find gray stone castles rather than sun drenched villas
CHI: the people look different too
CHI: taller and blonder than southern Italians and with plenty of German and Central European surnames
