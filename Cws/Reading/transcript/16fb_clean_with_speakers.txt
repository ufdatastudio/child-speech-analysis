CHI: so so here we are in Friuli
CHI: tucked away in in a remote corner of the Alpine foothills
CHI: in Northeastern Italy
CHI: at a little restaurant
CHI: I hafta admit that that that that that that that when I travel history is not the first thing on on my mind
CHI: food and wine are
CHI: and that's what sold me on Friuli
CHI: it is famous as a source of some of Italy's best white wines
CHI: we went primarily in in search of wines unaware that we soon would would make a culinary detour
CHI: occupying the extreme northeast corner of of of of Italy
CHI: Friuli scenery ranges from rugged coastline along the eastern border
CHI: to to to placid plains in the west and the majestic Alps in the north
CHI: where Italy butts up against Austria
CHI: directly to the south is is Venice
CHI: just a little more than an hour and a half away
CHI: though though off the beaten tourists track Friuli is hard in in the path of history
CHI: standing at one of the major crossroads between western Europe and the east
CHI: it was conquered by just about everyone who passed by
CHI: as a result things look different here
CHI: rather than the familiar cultural overlay of most of Italy
CHI: the central European influence is is readily apparent in in Friuli
CHI: the the architecture tend tends to more towards Austrian grandeur than than Tuscan simplicity
CHI: here you'll find gray gray gray stone castles rather rather than sun drenched villas
CHI: the people look different too taller and blonder than than than southern Italians
CHI: and with plenty of German and central European surnames
